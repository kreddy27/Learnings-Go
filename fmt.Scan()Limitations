# fmt.Scan() Limitations
The fmt.Scan() function is a great function for easily fetching & using user input through the command line.

But this function also has an important limitation: You can't (easily) fetch multi-word input values. Fetching text that consists of more than a single word is tricky with this function.

For the moment, we only need single words / digits as input, so that's no problem.

Later in the course, when we work on projects where more complex input values are required, you'll therefore learn about an alternative to fmt.Scan().
